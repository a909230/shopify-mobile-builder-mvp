You are helping the user build a Shopify "mobile app builder" MVP.

**Project Structure:**
- `mobile-app/`: React Native (Expo) consumer app.
- `mobile-builder-backend/`: Shopify Embedded App (Remix/Node).

**Current Status:**
1.  **Mobile App**:
    -   **Native Shopping Cart**: Working with `CartContext` and checkout URL generation.
    -   **Native Account Screen**:
        -   Customer Login (Email/Password).
        -   Order History List (Native UI).
    -   **Theming**:
        -   `ThemeContext` powers dynamic colors (Primary Color) and branding based on Store Config.
    -   **Server Settings**:
        -   `LoginScreen.js` now allows editing the Backend URL directly in the app (no code change needed for ngrok restarts).
    -   **Deep Linking**:
        -   Configured `mobilebuilder://` scheme (prepared for checkout callbacks).
2.  **Backend**:
    -   API `api/validate-code` returns Store Config & Token.
    -   **Scopes Updated**: Added `unauthenticated_write_customers` and `unauthenticated_read_customers` for customer login.
    -   **Dashboard**: Added "Regenerate Token" button to apply new scopes.
3.  **Git**:
    -   Repo: `https://github.com/a909230/shopify-mobile-builder-mvp`

**Goal for New Chat: "Homepage & Push Notifications"**
1.  **Homepage Customization**: Allow merchant to select "Featured Collection" or "Banner" in the admin, and render it natively.
2.  **Push Notifications**: Setup Expo Push Notifications for order updates.
3.  **App Store Prep**: Icon generation, splash screen finalization.

**Instructions for AI:**
-   The user has the app running.
-   The Account, Cart, and Product flows are working natively.
-   Focus on making the "Home" tab more dynamic and configurable by the merchant.
