You are helping the user build a Shopify "mobile app builder" MVP.

**Project Structure:**
- `mobile-app/`: React Native (Expo) consumer app.
- `mobile-builder-backend/`: Shopify Embedded App (Remix/Node).

**Current Status:**
1.  **Mobile App**:
    -   Running with `npx expo start --tunnel`.
    -   Native Tab Navigation works.
    -   Dependencies are fixed.
    -   **Pending**: Needs to update `LoginScreen.js` to use the new `storefrontAccessToken` returned by the backend.
2.  **Backend**:
    -   **Database Updated**: Added `storefrontAccessToken` to `StoreConfig` model.
    -   **Dashboard Updated**: Added "Enable Native App" button to generate the token.
    -   **API Updated**: `api/validate-code` now returns the token to the mobile app.
3.  **Git**:
    -   Repo: `https://github.com/a909230/shopify-mobile-builder-mvp`
    -   Latest commit: "Add storefront token support to backend".

**Immediate Action Required (Start of Session):**
The user has just restarted their computer.
1.  **Restart Environment**: Follow `RESTART_GUIDE.md`.
2.  **Generate Token**: User needs to go to the Backend Dashboard (press `p`) and click **"Enable Native App"** if they haven't already.
3.  **Next Coding Step**: Update `mobile-app/src/screens/LoginScreen.js` to save the `storefrontAccessToken` to `AsyncStorage` so other screens can use it to fetch products.

**Next Development Goals:**
1.  **Fetch Real Products**: Create a `ProductsScreen.js` that uses the token to fetch products via GraphQL.
2.  **Display Products**: Replace the `WebView` in the "Home" tab with this native list.
