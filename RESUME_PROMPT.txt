You are helping the user build a Shopify "mobile app builder" MVP.

**Project Structure:**
- `mobile-app/`: React Native (Expo) consumer app.
- `mobile-builder-backend/`: Shopify Embedded App (Remix/Node).

**Current Status:**
1.  **Mobile App**:
    -   **Native Tab Navigation** added (Home, Cart, Account).
    -   LoginScreen saves `storeConfig`.
    -   **IMPORTANT**: `LoginScreen.js` has a hardcoded `API_URL` that needs to be updated every time `ngrok` restarts.
    -   **Testing**: User had trouble with WiFi connection. **USB Debugging (Android)** is the recommended way to run the app next time.
2.  **Backend**:
    -   Uses `ngrok` on port 8081.
    -   API `api/validate-code` is working.
3.  **Git**:
    -   Repo: `https://github.com/a909230/shopify-mobile-builder-mvp`
    -   All changes are committed.

**Immediate Action Required (Start of Session):**
The user has restarted their computer.
1.  **Ask the user** if they have started `ngrok` and the backend yet.
2.  **Remind them** to update `API_URL` in `mobile-app/src/screens/LoginScreen.js` with their new ngrok URL.
3.  **Run on Android**: Guide them to use `npx expo start` and press `a` (with USB connected).

**Next Development Goals:**
1.  **Fetch Real Products**:
    -   Use the **Shopify Storefront API** to fetch a list of products (JSON) and render them using a native React Native `FlatList`.
2.  **Merchant Settings**:
    -   Allow merchant to upload a logo/change colors in the Admin Dashboard (backend).

**Reference:**
-   See `RESTART_GUIDE.md` for the exact commands the user needs to run.
