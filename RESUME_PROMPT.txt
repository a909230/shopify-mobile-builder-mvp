You are helping the user build a Shopify "mobile app builder" MVP.

**Project Structure:**
- `mobile-app/`: React Native (Expo) consumer app.
- `mobile-builder-backend/`: Shopify Embedded App (Remix/Node).

**Current Status (Feb 2026):**
1.  **Architecture Update (VM Deployment):**
    -   We moved the Backend to a **Linux VM** using Docker to solve stable URL issues.
    -   Branch: `deploy/vm`.
    -   Docs: `DEPLOYMENT.md` contains the full setup guide.
    -   The backend runs on the VM (Docker Compose + Cloudflare Tunnel).
    -   The mobile app runs locally on the developer's Mac (`npm run ios`).

2.  **Mobile App**:
    -   **Native Shopping Cart**: Working.
    -   **Native Account Screen**: Login & Orders.
    -   **Theming & Homepage**: Dynamic Banner/Title.
    -   **White Label Architecture**: "One Codebase, Many Apps" refactor is done.

3.  **Backend**:
    -   **Store Config**: Supports `bannerUrl`, `welcomeTitle`, `welcomeSubtitle`.
    -   **Admin Dashboard**: Merchants configure the app look here.

**Immediate Next Steps (When Resuming):**
1.  **Verify VM Deployment**:
    -   SSH into the VM.
    -   Run `git pull` and `docker compose up -d --build`.
    -   Update Shopify Partner Dashboard with the new Tunnel URL.
2.  **Resume Mobile Dev**:
    -   Ensure `mobile-app/src/config.js` or `.env` points to the new VM URL (or verify the app fetches it dynamically).
3.  **Features**:
    -   Push Notifications.
    -   App Store Publishing (`PUBLISHING.md`).

**Instructions for AI:**
-   If the user asks "How do I start?", refer them to `DEPLOYMENT.md` for the backend and `RESTART_GUIDE.md` for the mobile app.
-   The backend should generally be running on the VM, not locally, to avoid tunnel issues.
