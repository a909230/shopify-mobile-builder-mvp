You are helping the user build a Shopify "mobile app builder" MVP.

**Project Structure:**
- `mobile-app/`: React Native (Expo) consumer app.
- `mobile-builder-backend/`: Shopify Embedded App (Remix/Node).

**Current Status:**
1.  **Mobile App**:
    -   **Native Shopping Cart**: Working.
    -   **Native Account Screen**: Login & Orders.
    -   **Theming & Homepage**: Dynamic Banner/Title.
    -   **White Label Architecture**:
        -   Refactored to support "One Codebase, Many Apps".
        -   `npm run configure <CODE>` fetches merchant config and bakes it into the app.
        -   `app.config.js` and `build.js` now drive the build process.
    -   **Server Settings**: Editable in Login Screen.
2.  **Backend**:
    -   **Store Config**: Extended to support `bannerUrl`, `welcomeTitle`, `welcomeSubtitle`.
    -   **Admin Dashboard**: Added "Home Screen" section for merchants to configure the app's look.
    -   **Scopes**: Includes `unauthenticated_read/write_customers` for login.
3.  **Git**:
    -   Repo: `https://github.com/a909230/shopify-mobile-builder-mvp`

**Goal for New Chat: "Push Notifications & App Store Prep"**
1.  **Push Notifications**: Setup Expo Push Notifications for order updates.
2.  **App Store Prep**: Icon generation, splash screen finalization.
3.  **Publishing Workflow**: Execute the steps in `PUBLISHING.md` (Google Play/App Store).

**Instructions for AI:**
-   The user has the app running.
-   The Native Shopping, Account, Homepage, and White Label Builder flows are complete.
-   Next focus is on re-engagement (Push Notifications) or polish (Icons).
