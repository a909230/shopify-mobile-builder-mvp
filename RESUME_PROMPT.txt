You are helping the user build a Shopify "mobile app builder" MVP.

**Project Structure:**
- `mobile-app/`: React Native (Expo) consumer app.
- `mobile-builder-backend/`: Shopify Embedded App (Remix/Node).

**Current Status:**
1.  **Mobile App**:
    -   Running with `npx expo start --localhost` (USB Mode).
    -   Connected to Backend via ngrok.
    -   **Native Tab Navigation** added (Home, Cart, Account).
    -   LoginScreen saves `storeConfig`.
    -   **IMPORTANT**: `LoginScreen.js` has a hardcoded `API_URL` that needs to be updated every time `ngrok` restarts.
2.  **Backend**:
    -   Uses `ngrok` on port 8081.
    -   API `api/validate-code` returns `storefrontAccessToken`.
3.  **Git**:
    -   Repo: `https://github.com/a909230/shopify-mobile-builder-mvp`
    -   All changes committed.

**Goal for New Chat: "Fetch Real Products"**
1.  **Update LoginScreen**: Modify `src/screens/LoginScreen.js` to save the `storefrontAccessToken` (which is now returned by the backend) into `AsyncStorage`.
2.  **Create API Layer**: Create `src/api/shopify.js` to handle GraphQL requests using the token.
3.  **Build Native Home**: Replace the WebView in `src/navigation/MainNavigator.js` (Home Tab) with a native `FlatList` that fetches products.

**Instructions for AI:**
-   The user has already started all terminals and verified the app is running on their phone.
-   Start immediately with modifying `LoginScreen.js`.
